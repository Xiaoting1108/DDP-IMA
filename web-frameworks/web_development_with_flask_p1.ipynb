        "Python has several tools (packages) for building applications and websites – with perhaps the most well-known being [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/). However, while many of these are excellent tools, the benefit of using Flask is that it is a microframework – which is a long-winded way of saying it is possible to make lightweight (i.e. small and simple) apps as well as more complicated ones. Also, this \"lightweight-iness\" means that, comapred with Django and similar, Flask is less opionated on how you build a web app and more flexible. To begin with, we will start by installing the relevant packages:"

If you navigate to this endpoint (in my case \"http://0b1b-35-229-189-216.ngrok.io/randomised\") you'll see the same page but now \"Hello, World!\" has been replaced by \"Hello, {name}!\" where name is one of the five names in the _names_ dictionary we created. We have used randrange to draw a number >= 1 and < 6 and then used this as the key in our dictionary ... therefore drawing a random name. If you keep refreshing the page you'll see that it will randomly loops through the dictionary saying hello to different people.\n",
